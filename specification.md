## Background
Starting from thinking about a word, "communication".
In here, we extend and limit the meaning of "communication";
Every part of a process of passing something expressed by human (or machine) to other humans.
Important points of this meaning are;
the "something" includes the any kind of work,
and the receiver is a human, not a machine.
For example, both of writing and publishing this document and reading this document
are a part of "communication".

Also, every "communication" has one or more carriers
such as voices, books, and internet.
Carriers is one of the biggest concern about communication
because they have strong effects to communication.
As an example, when we use voices to communicate, it can not reach to Brazil from Japan
unless using other carriers, and
when a carrier is sensored by a bad dictator,
people can not express their feelings freely.
From above, we characterize good carriers by 4 factors.

1. Handle any kind of work:
People use many types of expression to communicate.
Someone writes a music, other draws a painting, and another uses a source code.
Equally important is new forms of expression are created, one after another, still now.
Good carriers should have capacity and flexibility to handle the various expressions.
2. Transport to everywhere:
People prefer spreading their expressions over the world
rather than building a wall around them.
We assume that a good carrier can transport our expression to anywhere we want to send.
3. Everyone is equal:
Inequality of power make us less creative.
If we had authoritarians on a carrier, we might be unjustly sensored or banned from there.
In a good carrier, each one of senders, receivers, and carriers should be equal,
and there is no trouble like that.
4. Network built by preferences:
Receivers can not take all of informations even if they could use their whole life.
Additionally, senders do not want to share their expressions to each living human on Earth
unless they are absolutely confident.
Therefore, receivers need to select sources, and senders need to select destination.
Good carriers should let them do.

From beginning with thinking about communication, finally, good carrier is illustrated.
Because we desire good carriers, Yayaka protocol is created.
Yayaka protocol is a minimal communication protocol
which tries to implement a good carrier in the current internet world.
